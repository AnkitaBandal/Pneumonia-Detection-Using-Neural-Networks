This project develops a deep learning-based system to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using CNN, ResNet50, VGG19, and InceptionV3 architectures. The dataset consists of 5,856 labeled X-ray images sourced from Mendeley. Data preprocessing includes resizing, augmentation, and balancing to improve model performance. Models were trained using binary cross-entropy loss, Adam and RMSprop optimizers, and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and loss. Among the models tested, ResNet50 achieved the highest validation accuracy of 94.01% with a recall of 94.26%, making it the most effective for pneumonia detection.

This study highlights the potential of AI in medical imaging, offering an automated and efficient solution for pneumonia diagnosis. The ResNet50 model demonstrated superior performance in identifying pneumonia while minimizing false positives and negatives. Future improvements could include optimizing hyperparameters, incorporating ensemble models, and expanding the dataset for better generalization. This repository contains the complete implementation, including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and model scripts. To run the project, install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt, train the model with python train.py, and evaluate it using python evaluate.py.
